# World_Weather_Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to create weather descriptions based on random locations around the world. I also identified potential travel destinations and hotels but adding input statements to filter the data for weather preferences. I choose four cities in Australia and created a travel itinerary and a map showing the travel route with markers.

Now it is time to go!
